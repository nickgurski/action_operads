% This section will study those $\Lambda$-operads for which each $P(n)$ is a category, and from here onwards any operad denoted $P$ is in $\mb{Cat}$. The extra structure that this $2$-categorical setting provides allows us to consider notions of pseudoalgebras for an operad, as well as pseudomorphisms of operads. We investigate the properties of the associated $2$-monads and the $2$-categorical properties of operads in $\mathbf{Cat}$, before describing the Borel construction for action operads. We later describe free $\Lambda$-monoidal categories along with abstract properties of the Borel construction.

In this section we will study those $\Lambda$-operads for which each $P(n)$ is a category, and from here onwards any operad denoted $P$ will be in $\mb{Cat}$. The extra structure of this $2$-categorical setting allows us to define pseudoalgebras and pseudomorphisms of operads, weakening the usual definitions of algebras and morphisms, respectively. Similarly, rather that associating a monad with an operad, we will consider associated $2$-monads, with their corresponding notions of pseudoalgebras. After investigating further $2$-categorical aspects of operads in $\mathbf{Cat}$, we describe the Borel construction for action operad, abstract properties of this construction, and free $\Lambda$-monoidal categories.


\subsection{Operads in \texorpdfstring{$\mb{Cat}$}{\textbf{Cat}}}\label{section:operads_in_Cat}
We have seen (\cref{op=monad1}) that given any $\Lambda$-operad $P$ there is an induced monad $\underline{P} \colon \m{C} \rightarrow \m{C}$ and that the category of algebras for the operad $P$ is isomorphic to the category of algebras for the monad $\underline{P}$, following \cite{maygeom}. Now we are considering $\Lambda$-operads in $\mathbf{Cat}$, the induced monad associated to an operad of this sort can be shown to be a $2$-monad (see \cite{KS} for background on $2$-monads) and we will proceed to show that the notions of pseudoalgebra for both the operad and the associated $2$-monad correspond precisely, i.e., there is an isomorphism of $2$-categories between the $2$-category with either strict or pseudo-level cells defined operadically and the $2$-category with either strict or pseudo-level cells defined $2$-monadically.



The associated monad $\underline{P}$ acquires the structure of a $2$-functor as follows. We define $\underline{P}$ on categories much like before as  the coproduct
    \[
        \underline{P}(X) = \coprod_n \coeq{P}{X}{\Lambda}{n},
    \]
whose objects will be written as equivalence classes $[p;x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ where $p \in P(n)$ and each $x_i \in X$, sometimes written as $[p;\underline{x}]$ when there is no confusion. On functors we define $\underline{P}$ in a similar way, exactly as with functions of sets. Given a natural transformation $\alpha \colon f \Rightarrow g$ we define a new natural transformation $\underline{P}(\alpha)$ as follows. The component of $\underline{P}(\alpha)$ at the object
    \[
        [p;x_1,\ldots,x_n]
    \]
is given by the morphism
    \[
        [1_p;\alpha_{x_1},\ldots,\alpha_{x_n}]
    \]
in $\underline{P}(X)$.
It is a simple observation that this constitutes a $2$-functor, and that the components of the unit and multiplication are functors and are $2$-natural.

\begin{rem}
The material in this section can be given a rather more abstract interpretation, in the sense of \cite{KL97}. The idea here is that the category of $\Lambda$-collections acts on the category $\mathbf{Cat}$ via a functor $\diamond \colon \Lambda\text{-}\mathbf{Coll} \times \mathbf{Cat} \rightarrow \mathbf{Cat}$ which sends $(P,X)$ to $\underline{P}(X)$ as described above. Fixing a $\Lambda$-collection $P$ produces an endofunctor $\underline{P} \colon \mathbf{Cat} \rightarrow \mathbf{Cat}$ which is then a monad when $P$ is a $\Lambda$-operad, just as monoids in $\Lambda\text{-}\mathbf{Coll}$ are precisely $\Lambda$-operads.
\end{rem}


First we will set out some conventions and definitions.
\begin{conv}\label{conv_coeq}
We will identify maps $\alpha_n \colon \coeq{P}{X}{\Lambda}{n} \rightarrow X$ with maps $\tilde{\alpha}_n \colon P(n) \times X^n \rightarrow X$ which are equivariant with respect to the $\Lambda$-actions via the universal property of the coequalizer. The coequalizer in $\mb{Cat}$ also has a $2$-dimensional aspect to its universal property, so that a natural transformation $\Gamma \colon \alpha_{n} \Rightarrow \beta_{n}$ between functors as above determines and is determined by a transformation $\tilde{\Gamma} \colon \tilde{\alpha}_{n} \Rightarrow \tilde{\beta}_{n}$ with the property that the two possible whiskerings of $\tilde{\Gamma}$ with the two functors $P(n) \times \Lambda(n) \times X^{n} \rightarrow P(n) \times X^{n}$ are equal.

Note also that in the following definitions we will often write the composite
    \[
        P(n) \times \prod_{i=1}^n \left(P(k_i) \times X^{k_i}\right) \rightarrow P(n) \times \prod_{i=1}^n P(k_i) \times X^{\Sigma k_i} \xrightarrow{\mu^P \times 1} P(\Sigma_{k_i}) \times X^{\Sigma k_i}
    \]
simply abbreviated as $\mu^P \times 1$. Furthermore, instead of using an element $\id \in P(1)$ as the operadic unit, we will now denote this as $\eta^{P} \colon 1 \rightarrow P(1)$.
\end{conv}

We begin with the definitions of the pseudo-level cells in the operadic context, and after each specialize to the strict version.

\begin{Defi}
Let $(X, \alpha_n,\phi,\phi_\eta)$ and $(Y, \beta_n,\psi,\psi_{\eta})$ be pseudoalgebras for a $\Lambda$-operad $P$. A \textit{strict morphism} of $P$-pseudoalgebras consists of a pseudomorphism in which all of the isomorphisms $\overline{f}_{n}$ are identities.
\end{Defi}

\begin{rem}
A strict algebra for a $\Lambda$-operad $P$ in $\mb{Cat}$ is precisely the same thing as an algebra for $P$ considered as an operad in the \textit{category} of small categories and functors. A strict morphism between strict algebras is then just a map of $P$-algebras in the standard sense. We could also consider the notion of a lax algebra for an operad, or a lax morphism of algebras, simply by considering natural transformations in place of isomorphisms in the definitions.

In \cref{def:ps-morph} of a pseudomorphism we did not originally make it clear that the isomorphisms $\overline{f}_n$ should satisfy an equivariance condition. This was highlighted in Remark 2.22 of Rubin's thesis \cite{rubin-thesis}. Similarly, this is also explicity stated as Definition 2.23 of \cite{guillou_symmetric}, as mentioned in \cite{guillou_multiplicative}. That we don't include an explicit equivariance axiom is due to Conventions \ref{conv_coeq}. In \cref{def:ps-morph} we require the existence of natural isomorphisms $f_n$ in order to induce corresponding natural isomorphisms $\overline{f}_n$. That the $\overline{f}_n$ are induced by the $f_n$ corresponds to the fact that the $\overline{f}_n$ satisfy an equivariance condition, namely that for $(\sigma, g, x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in P(n) \times \Lambda(n) \times X^n$, we have
  \[
    \left(\overline{f}_n\right)_{\left(\sigma \cdot g, x_1, \ldots, x_n\right)} = \left(\overline{f}_n\right)_{\left(\sigma,x_{g^{-1}(1)},\ldots,x_{g^{-1}(n)}\right)}.

We can form various $2$-categories using these cells.

\begin{Defi}
Let $P$ be a $\Lambda$-operad.
\begin{itemize}
\item The $2$-category $P\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}_{s}$ consists of strict $P$-algebras, strict morphisms, and $P$-transformations.
\item The $2$-category $\mb{Ps}\mbox{-}P\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}$ consists of $P$-pseudoalgebras, pseudomorphisms, and $P$-transformations.
\end{itemize}

We also have the corresponding $2$-monadic definitions, which we give for completeness. We state these for any $2$-category $\m{K}$, as specializing to $\mb{Cat}$ does not simplify them in any way.

Once again, we have $2$-categories defined using the different kinds of cells.

\begin{Defi}
Let $T$ be a $2$-monad.
\begin{itemize}
\item The $2$-category $T\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}_{s}$ consists of strict $T$-algebras, strict morphisms, and $T$-transformations.

Our main result in this section is the following, showing that one can consider algebras and higher cells, in either strict or pseudo strength, using either the operadic or $2$-monadic incarnation of a $\Lambda$-operad $P$. This extends \cref{op=monad1}.

\begin{thm}
Let $P$ be a $\Lambda$-operad in $\mb{Cat}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item There is an isomorphism of $2$-categories
    \[
        P\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}_{s} \cong \underline{P}\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}_{s}.
    \]
\item There is an isomorphism of $2$-categories
    \[
        \mb{Ps}\mbox{-}P\mbox{-}\mb{Alg} \cong \mb{Ps}\mbox{-}\underline{P}\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}
    \]
    extending the one above.
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
We begin by noting that we suppress the difference between $2$-cells $\Gamma$ and those $\tilde{\Gamma}$ as in Conventions \ref{conv_coeq}, implicitly always using $2$-cells defined on a coequalizer which are appropriately equivariant with respect to the group actions involved.

A proof of the first statement follows from our proof of the second by inserting identities where appropriate. Thus we begin by constructing a $2$-functor $R \colon \mb{Ps}\mbox{-}\underline{P}\mbox{-}\mb{Alg} \rightarrow \mb{Ps}\mbox{-}P\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}$. We map a $\underline{P}$-pseudoalgebra $(X,\alpha,\Phi,\Phi_\eta)$ to the following $P$-pseudoalgebra on the same category $X$. First we define the functor $\alpha_n$ to be the composite
    \[
        \xy
            (0,0)*+{\alpha_n \colon \coeq{P}{X}{\Lambda}{n}}="00";

            (55,0)*+{X.}="20";

whilst $\Phi_\eta$ is simply sent to itself, since the composition of $\alpha$ with the composite of the coequalizer and inclusion map from $P(1) \times X$ into $\underline{P}(X)$ is just $\tilde{\alpha_1}$. Checking the axioms here is most easily done on components and it can easily seen that the axioms required of this data to be a $P$-pseudoalgebra are precisely those that they satisfy by virtue of $X$ being a $\underline{P}$-pseudoalgebra.

For a $1$-cell $(f,\overline{f}) \colon (X, \alpha) \rightarrow (Y, \beta)$, we send $f$ to itself whilst sending $\overline{f}$ to the obvious family of isomorphisms, as follows.
    \[
        \xy
            (-30,0)*+{P(n) \times X^n}="-10";
            (-30,-15)*+{P(n) \times Y^n}="-11";

            (30,-15)*+{\underline{P}(Y)}="11";
            (60,-15)*+{Y}="21";
            {\ar@{^{(}->} "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar^{\alpha} "10" ; "20"};
            {\ar_{1 \times f^n} "00" ; "01"};
            {\ar_{\underline{P}f} "10" ; "11"};
            {\ar^{f} "20" ; "21"};
            {\ar@{^{(}->} "01" ; "11"};
            {\ar_{\beta} "11" ; "21"};
            {\ar "-10" ; "00"};
            {\ar "-11" ; "01"};
            {\ar_{1 \times f^n} "-10" ; "-11"};
            {\ar@{=>}^{\overline{f}} (45,-5.5) ; (45,-9.5)};
        \endxy
    \]

It is easy to check that the above data satisfy the axioms for being a pseudomorphism of $P$-pseudoalgebras, following from the axioms for $(f,\overline{f})$ being a pseudomorphism of $\underline{P}$-pseudoalgebras. A $\underline{P}$-transformation $\gamma \colon (f, \bar{f}) \Rightarrow (g, \bar{g})$ immediately gives a $P$-transformation $\bar{\gamma}$ between the families of isomorphisms we previously defined, with the components of $\bar{\gamma}$ being precisely those of $\gamma$. It is then easily shown that $R$ is a $2$-functor.

For there to be an isomorphism of $2$-categories, we require an inverse to $R$, namely a $2$-functor $S \colon \mb{Ps}\mbox{-}P\mbox{-}\mb{Alg} \rightarrow \mb{Ps}\mbox{-}\underline{P}\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}$. Now assume that $(X, \alpha_n, \phi_{\underline{k}_i}, \phi_\eta)$ is a $P$-pseudoalgebra. We will give the same object $X$ a $\underline{P}$-pseudoalgebra structure. We can induce a functor $\alpha \colon \underline{P}(X) \rightarrow X$ by using the universal property of the coproduct.
    \[
        \xy
            (-30,0)*+{P(n) \times X^n}="-10";
            (0,0)*+{\coeq{P}{X}{\Lambda}{n}}="00";
            (30,0)*+{\underline{P}(X)}="10";
            (30,-15)*+{X}="11";
            {\ar "-10" ; "00"};
            {\ar^{\alpha_n} "00" ; "11"};
            {\ar@{^{(}->} "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar^{\exists ! \alpha} "10" ; "11"};
            {\ar_{\tilde{\alpha}_n} "-10" ; "11"};
        \endxy
    \]

Of course, this can be induced using either $\alpha_n$ or $\tilde{\alpha}_n$, each giving the same functor $\alpha$ by uniqueness. The components of the isomorphism $\Phi \colon \alpha \circ \underline{P}(\alpha) \Rightarrow \alpha \circ \mu_X$ can be given as follows. Let $\left|\underline{x}_i\right|$ denote the number of objects in the list $\underline{x}_i$. Then define the component of $\Phi$ at the object
    \[
        \left[p;\left[q_1;\underline{x}_1\right],\ldots,\left[q_n;\underline{x}_n\right]\right]
    \]
to be the component of $\phi_{\left|\underline{x}_1\right|, \ldots, |\underline{x}_n|}$ at the same object. To make this clearer, consider the object $[p;[q_1;x_{11}],[q_2;x_{21},x_{22}],[q_3;x_{31}]]$. The component of $\Phi$ at this object is given by the component of $\phi_{1,2,1}$ at the same object. The isomorphism $\phi_\eta$ is again sent to itself.

Now given a $1$-cell $f$ with structure $2$-cells $\overline{f}_n$ we define a $1$-cell $(F,\overline{F})$ with underlying $1$-cell $f$ and structure $2$-cell $\overline{F}$ with components
    \[
        \overline{F}_{[p;x_1, \ldots, x_n]} := \left(\overline{f}_{n}\right)_{(p;x_1,\ldots,x_n)}.
    \]
For example, the component of $\overline{F}$ at the object $[p;x_1,x_2,x_3]$ would be the component of $f_3$ at the object $(p;x_1,x_2,x_3)$.

The mapping for $2$-cells is just the identity as before. These mappings again constitute a $2$-functor in the obvious way and from how they are defined it is also clear that this is an inverse to $R$.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
Another interpretation of pseudoalgebras can be given in terms of pseudomorphisms of operads. Algebras for an operad $P$ can be identified with a morphism of operads $F \colon P \rightarrow \mathcal{E}_X$, where $\mathcal{E}_X$ is the endomorphism operad (\cref{endoalg}). We can similarly define pseudomorphisms for a $\mathbf{Cat}$-enriched $\Lambda$-operad and identify pseudoalgebras with pseudomorphisms into the endomorphism operad.

If $P$, $Q$ are $\Lambda$-operads then a \textit{pseudomorphism} of $\Lambda$-operads $F \colon P \rightarrow Q$ consists of a family of $\Lambda$-equivariant functors
            \[
                \left(F_n \colon P(n) \rightarrow Q(n)\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
            \]
together with isomorphisms instead of the standard algebra axioms. For example, the associativity isomorphism has the following form.
            \[
                \xy
                    (0,0)*+{\scriptstyle P(n) \times \prod_i P(k_i)}="00";
                    (35,0)*+{\scriptstyle Q(n) \times \prod_i Q(k_i)}="10";
                    (0,-15)*+{\scriptstyle P(\Sigma k_i)}="01";
                    (35,-15)*+{\scriptstyle Q(\Sigma k_i)}="11";
                    {\ar^{F_n \times \prod_i F_{k_i}} "00" ; "10"};
                    {\ar^{\mu^Q} "10" ; "11"};
                    {\ar_{\mu^P} "00" ; "01"};
                    {\ar_{F_{\Sigma k_i}} "01" ; "11"};
                    {\ar@{=>}^{\psi_{k_1,\ldots,k_n}} (15,-5.5) ; (15,-9.5)};
                \endxy
            \]

These isomorphisms are then required to satisfy their own axioms, and these ensure that we have a weak map of $2$-monads $\underline{P} \Rightarrow \underline{Q}$. In particular, one can show that a pseudomorphism from $P$ into the endomorphism operad $\mathcal{E}_X$ produces pseudoalgebras for the operad $P$ using the closed structure on $\mb{Cat}$. While abstractly pleasing, we do not pursue this argument any further here.
\end{rem}

\subsection{$2$-categorical properties of operads in \texorpdfstring{$\mb{Cat}$}{\textbf{Cat}}}\label{sec:propofopsincat}

This section will be concerned with characterizing various properties of those $2$-monads induced by $\Lambda$-operads in $\mb{Cat}$. We first show that these $2$-monads are finitary. Second, we show that the coherence theorem in \cite{lack-cod} applies to all such $2$-monads and allows us to show that each pseudo-$\underline{P}$-algebra is equivalent to a strict $\underline{P}$-algebra (and so similarly, by our previous results, to the pseudoalgebras for a $\Lambda$-operad $P$). Both of these results are simple extensions of well-known results about operads. Finally, we give conditions for these $2$-monads to be $2$-cartesian, describing how they interact with certain limits, namely $2$-pullbacks. Operads do not always yield $2$-cartesian $2$-monads, and giving a complete characterization of when they do is more involved than our results on accessibility or coherence.

 For a $2$-monad $T$, the $2$-categories $\mb{Ps}\mbox{-}T\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}$ (of pseudoalgebras and weak morphisms) and $T\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}_s$ (of strict algebras and strict morphisms) are of particular interest. The behavior of colimits in both of these $2$-categories can often be deduced from properties of $T$, the most common being that $T$ is finitary. In practice, one thinks of a finitary monad as one in which all operations take finitely many inputs as variables. If $T$ is finitary, then $T\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}_s$ will be cocomplete by standard results given in \cite{BKP}. There are additional results of a purely $2$-dimensional nature concerning finitary $2$-monads, detailed in \cite{lack-cod} and extending those in \cite{BKP}, namely the existence of a left adjoint
    \[
        \mb{Ps}\mbox{-}T\mbox{-}\mb{Alg} \rightarrow T\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}_s
    \]
to the forgetful $2$-functor which regards a strict algebra as a pseudoalgebra with identity structure isomorphisms.

We begin by showing each associated $2$-monad is finitary.
\begin{prop}
Let $P$ be a $\Lambda$-operad. Then $\underline{P}$ is finitary.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
To show that $\underline{P}$ is finitary we must show that it preserves filtered colimits or, equivalently, that it preserves directed colimits (see \cite{ar}). Consider some directed colimit, $\text{colim}X_{i}$ say, in $\mathbf{Cat}$. Then consider the following sequence of isomorphisms:
    \begin{align*}
      \underline{P}(\text{colim}X_{i}) &= \coprod_n \coeq{P}{(\text{colim}X_{i})}{\Lambda}{n} \\
      &\cong \coprod_n P(n) \times_{\Lambda(n)} \text{colim}(X_{i}^n) \\
      &\cong \coprod_n \text{colim}(\coeq{P}{X_i}{\Lambda}{n}) \\
      &\cong \text{colim}\coprod_n \coeq{P}{X_i}{\Lambda}{n} \\
      &= \text{colim}\underline{P}(X_{i}).
    \end{align*}
Since $\mathbf{Cat}$ is locally finitely presentable then directed colimits commute with finite limits, giving the first isomorphism. The second isomorphism follows from this fact as well as that colimits commute with coequalizers. The third isomorphism is simply coproducts commuting with other colimits.
\end{proof}

The next part of this section is motivated by the issue of coherence. At its most basic, a coherence theorem is a way of describing when a notion of weaker structure is in some way equivalent to a stricter structure. The prototypical case here is the coherence theorem for monoidal categories. In a monoidal category we require associator isomorphisms
    \[
        \left( A \otimes B \right) \otimes C \cong A \otimes \left( B \otimes C \right)
    \]
for all objects in the category. The coherence theorem tells us that, for any monoidal category $M$, there exists a strict monoidal category which is equivalent to $M$. In other words, we can treat the associators in $M$ as identities, and similarly for the unit isomorphisms.

The abstract approach to coherence considers when the pseudoalgebras for a $2$-monad $T$ are equivalent to strict $T$-algebras, with the most comprehensive account appearing in \cite{lack-cod}. Lack gives a general theorem which provides sufficient conditions for the existence of a left adjoint to the forgetful $2$-functor
    \[
        U \colon T\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}_s \rightarrow \mb{Ps}\mbox{-}T\mbox{-}\mb{Alg}
    \]
for which the components of the unit of the adjunction are equivalences. We focus on one version of this general result which has hypotheses that are quite easy to check in practice. First we require that the base $2$-category $\mathcal{K}$ has an enhanced factorization system. This is much like an orthogonal factorization system on a $2$-category, consisting of two classes of maps $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$, satisfying the lifting properties on $1$-cells and $2$-cells as follows. Given a commutative square
     \[
        \xy
            (0,0)*+{A}="00";
            (15,0)*+{C}="10";
            (0,-15)*+{B}="01";
            (15,-15)*+{D}="11";
            {\ar^{f} "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar^{r} "10" ; "11"};
            {\ar_{l} "00" ; "01"};
            {\ar_{g} "01" ; "11"};
        \endxy
     \]
where $l \in \m{L}$ and $r \in {R}$, there exists a unique morphism $m \colon B \rightarrow C$ such that $rm = g$ and $ml = f$. Similarly, given two commuting squares for which $rf = gl$ and $rf' = f'l$, along with $2$-cells $\delta \colon f \Rightarrow f'$ and $\gamma \colon g \Rightarrow g'$ for which $\gamma \ast 1_l = 1_r \ast \delta$, there exists a unique $2$-cell $\mu \colon m \Rightarrow m'$, where $m$ and $m'$ are induced by the $1$-cell lifting property, satisfying $\mu \ast 1_l = \delta$ and $1_r \ast \mu = \gamma$. However, there is an additional $2$-dimensional property of the factorization system which says that given maps $l \in \m{L}$, $r \in \m{R}$ and an invertible $2$-cell $\alpha \colon rf \Rightarrow gl$
    \[
        \xy
            (0,0)*+{A}="00";
            (15,0)*+{C}="10";
            (0,-15)*+{B}="01";
            (15,-15)*+{D}="11";
            {\ar^{f} "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar^{r} "10" ; "11"};
            {\ar_{l} "00" ; "01"};
            {\ar_{g} "01" ; "11"};
            {\ar@{=>}^{\alpha} (9.375,-5.625) ; (5.625,-9.375)};
            (22.5,-7.5)*+{=};
            (30,0)*+{A}="20";
            (45,0)*+{C}="30";
            (30,-15)*+{B}="21";
            (45,-15)*+{D}="31";
            {\ar^{f} "20" ; "30"};
            {\ar^{r} "30" ; "31"};
            {\ar_{l} "20" ; "21"};
            {\ar_{g} "21" ; "31"};
            {\ar^{m} "21" ; "30"};
            {\ar@{=>}^{\beta} (41,-8) ; (38,-12)};
        \endxy
    \]
there exists a unique pair $(m,\beta)$ where $m \colon B \rightarrow C$ is a $1$-cell and $\beta \colon rm \Rightarrow g$ is an invertible $2$-cell such that $ml = f$ and $\beta \ast 1_{l} = \alpha$.

Further conditions require that $T$ preserve $\mathcal{L}$ maps and that whenever $r \in \mathcal{R}$ and $rk \cong 1$, then $kr \cong 1$. In our case we are considering $2$-monads on the $2$-category $\mathbf{Cat}$, which has the enhanced factorization system where $\m{L}$ consists of bijective-on-objects functors and $\m{R}$ is given by the full and faithful functors. This, along with the $2$-dimensional property making it an enhanced factorization system, is described in \cite{power-gen}. The last stated condition, involving isomorphisms and maps in $\m{R}$, is then clearly satisfied and so the only thing we need to check in order to satisfy the conditions of the coherence result are that the induced $2$-monads $\underline{P}$ preserve bijective-on-objects functors, which follows simply from the fact that the set of objects functor, $\ob \colon \mb{Cat} \rightarrow \mb{Set}$, preserves colimits, being left adjoint to the indiscrete category functor, $E \colon \mb{Set} \rightarrow \mb{Cat}$, as described in \cref{symmoncor}.

\begin{prop}
For any $\Lambda$-operad $P$, the $2$-monad $\underline{P}$ preserves bijective-on-objects functors.
\end{prop}
\begin{cor}
Every pseudo-$\underline{P}$-algebra is equivalent to a strict $\underline{P}$-algebra.
\end{cor}



We finally turn to a discussion of the interaction between operads and pullbacks. The monads arising from a non-symmetric operad are always cartesian, as described in \cite{leinster}. The monads that arise from symmetric operads, however, are not always cartesian and so it is useful to be able to characterize exactly when they are. An example of where this fails is the symmetric operad for which the algebras are commutative monoids. In the case of $2$-monads we can consider the  strict $2$-limit analogous to the pullback, the $2$-pullback, and characterize when the induced $2$-monad from a $\Lambda$-operad is $2$-cartesian, as we now describe.

\begin{Defi}
A $2$-monad $T \colon \mathcal{K} \rightarrow \mathcal{K}$ is said to be \textit{$2$-cartesian} if
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the $2$-category $\mathcal{K}$ has $2$-pullbacks,
        \item the functor $T$ preserves $2$-pullbacks, and
        \item the naturality squares for the unit and multiplication of the $2$-monad are $2$-pullbacks.
    \end{itemize}
\end{Defi}

It is important to note that the  $2$-pullback of a diagram is actually the same as the ordinary pullback in $\mb{Cat}$, see \cite{kelly-elem}. Since we will be computing with coequalizers of the form $\coeqb{A}{B}{\Lambda}$ repeatedly, we give the following useful lemma.

\begin{lem}\label{coeq-lem}
Let $G$ be a group and let $A$, $B$ be categories for which $A$ has a right action by $G$ and $B$ has a left action by $G$. An action of $G$ on the product $A \times B$ can then be defined by
    \[
        (a,b) \cdot g \colon = \left(a \cdot g, g^{-1} \cdot b\right).
    \]
If this action of $G$ on $A \times B$ is free, then the category $(A \times B)/G$, consisting of the equivalence classes of this action, is isomorphic to the coequalizer $\coeqb{A}{B}{G}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
The category $A \times_G B$ is defined as the coequalizer
    \[
        \xy
            (0,0)*+{A \times G \times B}="00";
            (30,0)*+{A \times B}="10";
            (60,0)*+{\coeqb{A}{B}{G}}="20";
            {\ar@<1ex>^{\lambda} "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar@<-1ex>_{\rho} "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar^{\varepsilon} "10" ; "20"};
        \endxy
    \]
where $\lambda(a,g,b) = (a \cdot g, b)$ and $\rho(a,g,b) = (a, g \cdot b)$. However, the map $A \times B \rightarrow (A \times B)/G$, sending $(a,b)$ to the equivalence class $[a,b] = [a \cdot g, g^{-1} \cdot b]$, also coequalizes $\lambda$ and $\rho$ since
    \[
        [a \cdot g, b] = \left[(a \cdot g) \cdot g^{-1}, g \cdot b\right] = [a, g \cdot b].
    \]

Given any other category $X$ and a functor $\chi \colon A \times B \rightarrow X$ which coequalizes $\lambda$ and $\rho$, we define a functor $\phi \colon (A \times B)/G \rightarrow X$ by $\phi[a,b] = \chi(a,b)$. That this is well-defined is clear, since
    \[
        \phi\left[a \cdot g, g^{-1} \cdot b\right] = \chi\left(a \cdot g, g^{-1} \cdot b\right) = \chi\left(a \cdot \left(gg^{-1}\right), b\right) = \chi(a, b) = \phi[a,b].
    \]
This is also unique and so we find that $(A \times B)/G$ satisfies the universal property of the coequalizer.
\end{proof}

We begin our study of the cartesian property in the context of symmetric operads.

\begin{prop}\label{cart_unit}
Let $P$ be a symmetric operad. Then the unit $\eta \colon \id \Rightarrow \underline{P}$ for the associated monad is a cartesian transformation.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
In order to show that $\eta$ is cartesian, we must prove that for a functor $f \colon X \rightarrow Y$, the pullback of the following diagram is the category $X$.
    \[
        \xy
            (40,0)*+{Y}="10";
            (0,-15)*+{\coprod \coeqsig{P}{X}{n}}="01";
            (40,-15)*+{\coprod \coeqsig{P}{Y}{n}}="11";
            {\ar^{\eta_Y} "10" ; "11"};
            {\ar_{\underline{P}(f)} "01" ; "11"};
        \endxy
    \]
The pullback of this diagram is isomorphic to the coproduct of the pullbacks of diagrams of the following form.
\[
        \xy
            (30,0)*+{Y}="10";
            (0,-15)*+{P(1) \times X}="01";
            (30,-15)*+{P(1) \times Y}="11";
            {\ar^{} "10" ; "11"};
            {\ar_{1 \times f} "01" ; "11"};
            % (45,-7.5)*{};
            (90,0)*+{\emptyset}="60";
            (60,-15)*+{\coeqsig{P}{X}{n}}="51";
            (90,-15)*+{\coeqsig{P}{Y}{n}}="61";
            {\ar^{} "60" ; "61"};
            {\ar_{1 \times f^n} "51" ; "61"};
            (75,-21)*{n \neq 1}
        \endxy
    \]
It is easy then to see that $X$ is the pullback of the $n=1$ cospan, and that the empty category is the pullback of each of the other cospans, making $X$ the pullback of the original diagram and verifying that $\eta$ is cartesian.
\end{proof}


\begin{prop}
Let $P$ be a symmetric operad. Then the $2$-monad $\underline{P}$ preserves pullbacks if and only if $\Sigma_{n}$ acts freely on $P(n)$ for all $n$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Consider the following pullback of discrete categories.
    \[
        \xy
            (0,0)*+{\lbrace (x,y), (x,y'), (x',y), (x',y') \rbrace}="00";
            (40,0)*+{\lbrace y,y' \rbrace}="10";
            (0,-15)*+{\lbrace x, x' \rbrace}="01";
            (40,-15)*+{\lbrace z \rbrace}="11";
            {\ar "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar "10" ; "11"};
            {\ar "00" ; "01"};
            {\ar "01" ; "11"};
        \endxy
    \]
Letting $\mathbf{4}$ denote the pullback and similarly writing $\mathbf{2}_X = \{ x, x' \}$ and $\mathbf{2}_Y = \{y, y'\}$, the following diagram results as the image of this pullback square under $\underline{P}$.
    \[
        \xy
            (0,0)*+{\coprod \coeqsig{P}{\mathbf{4}}{n}}="00";
            (40,0)*+{\coprod \coeqsig{P}{\mathbf{2}_Y}{n}}="10";
            (0,-15)*+{\coprod \coeqsig{P}{\mathbf{2}_X}{n}}="01";
            (40,-15)*+{\coprod P(n)/\Sigma_n}="11";
            {\ar "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar "10" ; "11"};
            {\ar "00" ; "01"};
            {\ar "01" ; "11"}:
        \endxy
    \]
The projection map $\underline{P}(\mb{4}) \rightarrow \underline{P}(\mb{2}_Y)$ maps an element
    \[
        [p;(x_1,y_1), \ldots, (x_n,y_n)]
    \]
to the element
    \[
        [p;y_1,\ldots,y_n]
    \]
and likewise for the projection to $\underline{P}(\mb{2}_X)$.

Now assume that, for some $n$, the action of $\Sigma_n$ on $P(n)$ is not free. Then find some $p \in P(n)$ along with a nonidentity element $g \in \Sigma_n$ such that $p \cdot g = p$. We will show that the existence of $g$ proves that $\underline{P}$ is not cartesian.

Now $g \neq e$, so there exists an $i$ such that $g(i) \neq i$; without loss of generality, we may take $i=1$. Using this $g$ we can find two distinct elements
    \[
        \left[p;(x',y),(x,y),\ldots,(x,y),(x,y'),(x,y),\ldots,(x,y)\right]
    \]
and
    \[
        \left[p;(x,y),\ldots,(x,y),(x',y'),(x,y),\ldots,(x,y)\right]
    \]
in $\underline{P}(\mb{4})$. In the first element we put $(x',y)$ in the first position and $(x,y')$ in position $g(1)$, whilst in the second element we put $(x',y')$ in position $g(1)$. Both of these elements, however, are mapped to the same elements in $\underline{P}(\mb{2}_X)$, since
    \begin{align*}
           \left[p; x', x, \ldots, x\right]&= \left[p \cdot g; (x', x, \ldots, x)\right]\\
          &= \left[p;g\cdot (x', x, \ldots, x)\right]\\
          &= \left[p;x,x,\ldots,x',\ldots,x\right].
    \end{align*}
Similarly, both of the elements are mapped to the same element in $\underline{P}(\mathbf{2}_Y)$, simply
    \[
        \left[p;y,\ldots,y', \ldots, y\right].
    \]
The pullback of this diagram, however, has a unique element which is projected to the ones we have considered, so $\underline{P}(\mb{4})$ is not a pullback. Hence $\underline{P}$ does not preserve pullbacks if for some $n$ the action of $\Sigma_n$ on $P(n)$ is not free.

Now assume that each $\Sigma_n$ acts freely on $P(n)$. Given a pullback
    \[
        \xy
            (0,0)*+{A}="00";
            (15,0)*+{B}="10";
            (0,-15)*+{C}="01";
            (15,-15)*+{D}="11";
            {\ar^{F} "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar^{S} "10" ; "11"};
            {\ar_{R} "00" ; "01"};
            {\ar_{H} "01" ; "11"};
        \endxy
    \]
we must show that the image of the diagram under $\underline{P}$ is also a pullback. Now this will be true if and only if each individual diagram
        \[
            \xy
                (0,0)*+{\coeqsig{P}{A}{n}}="00";
                (30,0)*+{\coeqsig{P}{B}{n}}="10";
                (0,-15)*+{\coeqsig{P}{C}{n}}="01";
                (30,-15)*+{\coeqsig{P}{D}{n}}="11";
                {\ar^{1 \times F^n} "00" ; "10"};
                {\ar^{1 \times S^n} "10" ; "11"};
                {\ar_{1 \times R^n} "00" ; "01"};
                {\ar_{1 \times H^n} "01" ; "11"}:
            \endxy
    \]
is also a pullback. The pullback of the functors $1 \times H^n$ and $1 \times S^n$ is a category consisting of pairs of objects $[p;\underline{c}]$ and $[q;\underline{b}]$, where $\underline{b}$ and $\underline{c}$ represent lists of elements in $B$ and $C$, respectively. These pairs are then required to satisfy the property that
    \[
        \left[p;\underline{H(c)}\right] = \left[q; \underline{S(b)}\right].
    \]
Using Lemma \ref{coeq-lem}, we know that a pair
    \[
        \left(\left[p;\underline{c}\right], \left[q;\underline{b}\right]\right)
    \]
is in the pullback if and only if there exists an element $g \in \Sigma_n$ such that $p \cdot g = q$ and $Hc_i = (Sb_{g^{-1}(i)})$. Using this we can define mutual inverses between $\coeqsig{P}{A}{n}$ and the pullback $Q'$. Considering the category $A$ as the pullback of the diagram we started with, we can consider objects of $\coeqsig{P}{A}{n}$ as being equivalence classes
    \[
        [p;(b_1,c_1),\ldots,(b_n,c_n)]
    \]
where $p \in P(n)$ and $Hc_i = Sb_i$ for all $i$.

Taking such an object, we send it to the pair
    \[
        \left(\left[p;c_1,\ldots,c_n\right],[p;b_1,\ldots,b_n]\right)
    \]
which lies in the pullback since the identity in $\Sigma_n$ satisfies the condition given earlier. An inverse to this sends a pair of equivalence classes in $Q'$ to the single equivalence class
    \[
        \left[p;\left(c_1,b_{g^{-1}(1)}\right),\ldots,\left(c_n,b_{g^{-1}(n)}\right)\right]
    \]
in $\coeqsig{P}{A}{n}$. If we apply the map into $Q'$ we get the pair
    \[
        \left(\left[p;c_1,\ldots,c_n\right],\left[p;b_{g^{-1}(1)},\ldots,b_{g^{-1}(n)}\right]\right)
    \]
which is equal to the original pair since $p \cdot g = q$; the other composite is trivially an identity. A similar calculation on morphisms finishes the proof that $\coeqsig{P}{A}{n}$ is the pullback as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Let $P$ be a symmetric operad. If the $\Sigma_n$-actions are all free, then the multiplication $\mu \colon  \underline{P}^{2} \Rightarrow \underline{P}$ of the associated monad is a cartesian transformation.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Note that if all of the diagrams
    \[
        \xy
            (0,0)*+{\underline{P}^2(X)}="00";
            (20,0)*+{\underline{P}^2(1)}="10";
            (0,-15)*+{\underline{P}(X)}="01";
            (20,-15)*+{\underline{P}(1)}="11";
            {\ar^{\underline{P}^2(!)} "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar^{\mu_1} "10" ; "11"};
            {\ar_{\mu_X} "00" ; "01"};
            {\ar_{\underline{P}(!)} "01" ; "11"};
        \endxy
    \]
are pullbacks then the outside of the diagram
    \[
        \xy
            (0,0)*+{\underline{P}^2(X)}="00";
            (20,0)*+{\underline{P}^2(Y)}="10";
            (40,0)*+{\underline{P}^2(1)}="20";
            (0,-15)*+{\underline{P}(X)}="01";
            (20,-15)*+{\underline{P}(Y)}="11";
            (40,-15)*+{\underline{P}(1)}="21";
            {\ar^{\underline{P}^2(f)} "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar^{\underline{P}^2(!)} "10" ; "20"};
            {\ar^{\mu_{1}} "20" ; "21"};
            {\ar_{\mu_X} "00" ; "01"};
            {\ar_{\underline{P}(f)} "01" ; "11"};
            {\ar_{\underline{P}(!)} "11" ; "21"};
            {\ar_{\mu_Y} "10" ; "11"};
        \endxy
    \]
is also a pullback and so each of the naturality squares for $\mu$ must therefore be a pullback. Now we can split up the square above, much like we did for $\eta$, and prove that each of the squares below is a pullback.
    \[
        \xy
            (0,0)*+{\coprod P(m) \times_{\Sigma_m} \prod_i \left(\coeqsig{P}{X}{{k_i}}\right)}="00";
            (60,0)*+{\coprod P(m) \times_{\Sigma_m} \prod_i \left(P(k_i) / \Sigma_{k_i}\right)}="10";
            (0,-20)*+{\coeqsig{P}{X}{n}}="01";
            (60,-20)*+{P(n) / \Sigma_{n}}="11";
            {\ar "00" ; "10"};
            {\ar "00" ; "01"};
            {\ar "01" ; "11"};
            {\ar "10" ; "11"};
        \endxy
    \]
The map along the bottom is the obvious one, sending $[p; x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ simply to the equivalence class $[p]$. Along the right hand side the map is the one corresponding to operadic composition, sending $[q;[p_1],\ldots,[p_m]]$ to $[\mu^P(q;p_1,\ldots,p_n)]$. The pullback of these maps would be the category consisting of pairs
    \[
        \left([p;x_1,\ldots,x_{\Sigma k_i}],[q;[p_1],\ldots,[p_n]]\right),
    \]
where $q \in P(n)$, $p_i \in P(k_i)$, $p \in P(\Sigma k_i)$, and for which $[p] = [\mu^P(q;p_1,\ldots,p_n)]$. The upper left category in the diagram, which we will refer to here as $Q$, has objects
    \[
        \left[q;\left[p_1;\underline{x}_1\right],\ldots,\left[p_n;\underline{x}_n\right]\right].
    \]

% QQQ (Describe these.)
There are obvious maps out of $Q$ making the diagram commute and as such inducing a functor from $Q$ into the pullback via the universal property. This functor sends an object such as the one just described to the pair
    \[
        \left(\left[\mu^P(q;p_1,\ldots,p_n);\underline{x}\right], [q;[p_1],\ldots,[p_n]]\right).
    \]
Given an object in the pullback, we then have a pair, as described above, which has $[p] = [\mu^P(q;p_1,\ldots,p_n)]$ meaning that we can find an element $g \in \Sigma_{\Sigma k_i}$ such that $p  = \mu^P(q;p_1,\ldots,p_n) \cdot g$. Thus we can describe an inverse to the induced functor by sending a pair in the pullback to the object
    \[
        [q;[p_1;\pi(g)(\underline{x})_1],\ldots,[p_n;\pi(g)(\underline{x})_n]],
    \]
where $\pi(g)(\underline{x})_i$ denotes the $i$th block of $\underline{x}$ after applying the permutation $\pi(g)$. For example, if $\underline{x} = (x_{11}, x_{12}, x_{21}, x_{22}, x_{23}, x_{31})$ and $\pi(g) = (1\, \, 3 \, \, 5)$, then
    \[
        \pi(g)(\underline{x}) = (x_{23}, x_{12}, x_{11}, x_{22}, x_{21}, x_{31}).
    \]
Thus $\pi(g)(\underline{x})_1 = (x_{23}, x_{12})$, $\pi(g)(\underline{x})_2 = (x_{11}, x_{22}, x_{21})$ and $\pi(g)(\underline{x})_3 = (x_{31})$.

Now applying the induced functor we find that we get back an object in the pullback for which the first entry is $[q;[p_1],\ldots,[p_n]]$ and whose second entry is
    \[
       \left[\mu^P(q;p_1,\ldots,p_n);\pi(g)(\underline{x})\right] = \left[\mu^P(q;p_1,\ldots,p_n) \cdot g;\underline{x}\right] = [p;\underline{x}],
    \]
which is what we started with. Showing the other composite is an identity is similar, here using the fact that the identity acts trivially on $\mu^P(q;p_1,\ldots,p_n)$. Taking the coproduct of these squares then gives us the original diagram that we wanted to show was a pullback and, since each individual square is a pullback, so is the original.
\end{proof}

Collecting these results together gives the following corollary.

\begin{cor}\label{cart_cor}
The $2$-monad associated to a symmetric operad $P$ is $2$-cartesian if and only if the action of $\Sigma_n$ is free on each $P(n)$.
\end{cor}

We require one simple technical lemma before giving a complete characterization of $\Lambda$-operads which induce cartesian $2$-monads.

\begin{lem}\label{kernel_lem}
Let $C$ be a category with a right action of some group $\Lambda$, and let $\pi \colon  \Lambda \rightarrow \Sigma$ be a group homomorphism to any other group $\Sigma$. Then the right $\Sigma$-action on $\coeqb{C}{\Sigma}{\Lambda}$ is free if and only if the only elements of $\Lambda$ which fix an object of $C$ lie in the kernel of $\pi$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
First, note that a group action on a category is free if and only if it is free on objects as fixing a morphism requires fixing its source and target. Thus our arguments need only concern the objects involved.

Since the set of objects functor preserves colimits, the objects of $\coeqb{C}{\Sigma}{\Lambda}$ are equivalence classes $[c;g]$ where $c \in C$ and $g \in \Sigma$, with $[c\cdot r;g] = [c; \pi(r)g]$. First assume the $\Sigma$-action is free. Then noting that $[c;e]\cdot g =[c;g]$, we have if $[c;g] = [c;e]$ then $g=e$. Let $r \in \Lambda$ be an element such that $c\cdot r = c$. Then
  \[
    [c;e] = [c\cdot r; e] = [c; \pi(r)],
  \]
so $\pi(r) = e$.

Now assume that every element of $\Lambda$ fixing an object lies in the kernel of $\pi$. Let $\tau \in \Sigma$, and assume it fixes $[p; \sigma]$. Without loss of generality, we can take $\sigma = e$, so that
  \[
    [p; \tau] = [p;e]\cdot \tau = [p;e].
  \]
Since the objects of $\coeqb{C}{\Sigma}{\Lambda}$ are equivalence classes as above, there exists an element $r \in \Lambda$ such that $p\cdot r^{-1} = p$ and $\tau = \pi(r)$. But by assumption, we must have $r^{-1}$, and hence $r$, in the kernel, so $\tau = e$ and the $\Sigma$-action is free.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{cart_thm}
The $2$-monad associated to a $\Lambda$-operad $P$ is $2$-cartesian if and only if whenever $p \cdot g = p$ for an object $p \in P(n)$, $g \in \textrm{Ker} \, \pi (n)$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Since the monad $\underline{P}$ is isomorphic to $\underline{S(P)}$, we need only verify when $\underline{S(P)}$ is $2$-cartesian. Thus the theorem is a direct consequence of \cref{kernel_lem} and \cref{cart_cor}.
\end{proof}
