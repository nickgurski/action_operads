	abstract = {In this work we establish a 2-categorical analogue of Beck's theorem characterizing monadic functors. We show that a 2-functor (a pseudo-functor) U is monadic iff it is a right pseudo-adjoint, it reflects adjoint equivalences and it creates U-absolute pseudo-coequalizers of codescent objects.},
