These are the things we don't like very much:

Section 1:
1. Obviously we still need a real intro, one that takes into account later work explicitly
2. I think the Conventions 1.1 could probably use with some more entries, maybe a better location

Section 2:
1. I think some of sec 2.1 is in an odd order; also if we are thinking that this is on the expository side, it doesn't explain much
2. Example 2.12 makes it look like we won't talk about ribbon braids, but then we do in 2.13; should just reorganize these examples
3. Is the proof of 2.21 too long/janky?
4. 2.22 has a notational issue since we have both $T$ (operad) and $\mathbf{T}$ (action operad) notation
5. I think 2.23 is overcomplicating things, since pure = in the kernel.
6. Should 2.24 be made into a proposition and expanded a little?
7. Seems like 2.25 should have come earlier
8. Check 2.32
9. Should 2.35 come earlier?
10. Is the last part of the proof of 2.36 right? seems to contradict 2.35
11. Should maybe give an example of a presentation of an action operad
