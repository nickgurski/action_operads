	abstract = {We prove a multiplicative version of the equivariant Barratt-Priddy-Quillen theorem, starting from the additive version proven in arXiv:1207.3459. The proof uses a multiplicative elaboration of an additive equivariant infinite loop space machine that manufactures orthogonal \$G\$-spectra from symmetric monoidal \$G\$-categories. The new machine produces highly structured associative ring and module \$G\$-spectra from appropriate multiplicative input. It relies on new operadic multicategories that are of considerable independent interest and are defined in a general, not necessarily equivariant or topological, context. Most of our work is focused on constructing and comparing them. We construct a multifunctor from the multicategory of symmetric monoidal \$G\$-categories to the multicategory of orthogonal \$G\$-spectra. With this machinery in place, we prove that the equivariant BPQ theorem can be lifted to a multiplicative equivalence. That is the heart of what is needed for the presheaf reconstruction of the category of \$G\$-spectra in arXiv:1110.3571.},
