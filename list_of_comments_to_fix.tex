\section{ Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item

\end{itemize}
\section{ Action operads}
\begin{itemize}
\item I put in G0abel (2.3.8) to prove: typed in proof of abelianness but need to show that $\mu(e_2;g,h) = gh$ (suffices to show that $\mu(e_2;g, e_0) = g$). Thought it would be a straightforward Eckmann-Hilton argument but it gets stuck.
% \item and we should put in a proof that all the $\pi$'s are surjective or trivial (2.3.4)
\item Proof of 2.3.4: just needs checking
\item I have been changing tensor product to block sum for a lot of things, we need to go through and decide how to do that consistently
% \item Defn 2.3.9 - specify what the $h$'s and $g$'s are.
\item Prop 2.5.19 follows from Theorem 3.3.8, except for the part about the monad map (it can't be $(F,id)$ as it needs to use the coherence cells of $F$, so I've called it $(F,\psi^F)$ and added details to the propositions).
\end{itemize}

\section{Operads in the category of categories}
\begin{itemize}
% \item Start of 3.1: Should the $2$-monad should have $EP(n)$? Compare with 3.3.9.
% \item Defn 3.3.7 of cocomplete symmetric monoidal cat
% \item After 3.3.9 seems repetitive (essentially description of $\underline{P}$)
\item Prop 3.3.11-4 The proofs need filling out
\item Should we change $E\Lambda(n) \times X^n/\Lambda(n)$ to be $\left(E\Lambda(n) \times X^n\right)/\Lambda(n)$?
\end{itemize}

\section{ Monoidal structures and multicategories}

\begin{itemize}
\item Intro
\item Use \begin{verbatim} \lmc \end{verbatim} for lambda monoidal categories
% \item `By standard methods' - reference for adjoint equivalence (Mac Lane Chapter 4 Section 4 Theorem 1)
% \item Invertible unit: follows from adjoint equivalence
% \item Theorem 4.2.11: `Define $\beta$ by' should have $s_{p_1+r_1,q_1+r_1}$ on the RHS, not $s_{p_1,q_1}$? (Fine because $r_1 = 0$. Clarified.)
% \item `Containment relation': Reference back to wherever this is stated.
% \item Defn 4.3.1: $\pi$ is surjective or each $\pi_n$ is surjective?
\item Lemma 4.3.2: Needs rewording. Is the \textit{underlying set of the free monoid}?
% \item Prop 4.3.3: Is $im(\pi)$ defined? It is now.
% \item Prop 4.3.3: What is the underlying permutation operad? Does this mean the symmetrized operad?
% \item Odd sentence before definition of \text{spatial}
% \item In \textit{spatial} defn: use a diagram?
% \item Should there be a string diagram here to demonstrate spatialness
% \item ...on the spatiality of algebra \textit{and so $\Lambda$-monoidal categories}.
% \item an $E\Lambda$ or a $\Lambda$-monoidal
% \item Lemma 4.3.5: Spacing of equations needs fixing.
% \item $\Lambda(2)$ not $G(2)$
% \item What is an action morphism? Update: Been through Ed's thesis. From what I can gather, they are morphisms which look like $\alpha(g; id_{x_1}, \ldots, id_{x_n})$.
\item Re: What is an action morphism? Added a remark (4.3.5 or near) to give some reference.
% \item Include the extra steps in the first equations and finish with a period.
% \item Get rid of \textit{we're}
% \item Make sure sentences around here are finished with a period.
% \item Remove $\cdot$ and $\circ$ where not used elsewhere
% \item Rewrite equations at the end of the proof (spacing and add some words)
% \item Change the word `finally'
% \item Change `a bit of new terminology'
\item Do we want another notation to emphasise the underlying monoid? (Think we settled on $\Lambda^{\oplus}$?)
% \item `Then we will also \textit{use}'
\item Lemma 4.3.8: Should be a $\Lambda^{\oplus}$, not just $\Lambda$.
% \item $\Lambda$ not $G$
% \item Spacing of $\alpha$
% \item 4.3.8: extra couple of steps to show $\alpha$ is a monoid homomorphism? (Not needed. It's a functor so this follows straight off.)
% \item Defn 4.4.3: Check spacing of the strength maps with subscripts
% \item Remark 4.4.4: It's mostly described but not directly shown about the strength axioms?
% \item Change sentence to be \textit{further} notation
% \item Theorem 4.4.5: overfull hbox on second page of proof
% \item Spacing of labels on arrows needs looking at
% \item Corollary 4.4.6: Still don't like the terminology `non-symmetric'. Is `plain' operad better? (Came to the conclusion that everybody just uses non-$\Sigma$ or non-symmetric, so better to stick with that. Guessing I picked up `plain' from Tom's book.)
\item Defn 4.5.1: Odd mix of $\alpha$ and $g$. Think something is mixed up here. ($- \cdot \alpha$). Also should the iso have $\pi(g)^{-1}$ in the target?
\item Monad maps are defined in the specific case of the $2$-category of categories in Section 2.5 - refer back to these definitions.
\end{itemize}



\section{ Invertible objects}

\begin{itemize}
\item The notation in the very first sentence needs to be explained somewhere!
\item Rewrite intro: Need to explain that the goal is to understand some group actions
\item Decide on ELambda algebras or Lambda monoidal categories throughout (we decided the second!)
\item New notation: added earlier (line 905, search beta\_to\_oplus), just need to implement, search for action maps or superscript tensors
\item Fix weakly invertible section
\end{itemize}

Leftover fixes that I'm not sure about:
\begin{itemize}
\item Move comment (QQQ)
\item Fix paragraph; make clear we are determining composition
\item Explain M strategy, include forward refs
\end{itemize}



\section{ Invertibility and group actions}

\begin{itemize}
\item I want to write $\Lambda^{\oplus}$ for the underlying monoid maybe??
\item \textbf{why? This one involves real math}
\item not happy with last section
\end{itemize}



\section{ Computing automorphisms of the unit}

\begin{itemize}




\item 4.1.3 check 2.3.10: need to make sure this is in an earlier section, and ref'ed


\item explain purpose
\item improve proof 4.2.3

\item check commutative Square

\item redo 4.4
\item insert diagram

\item consistent text after 4.5.3
\item move something to earlier


\item highlight that star means the inverse under tensor product for morphisms




\item check the note


\end{itemize}



\section{a full description of $L_n $}

\begin{itemize}


\item Think about n vs 2n in {AGndef}
\item check reference
\item rewrite calculation
\item check universal property
\item insert for a simple example
\end{itemize}



\section{ Examples}

\begin{itemize}
\item Actually read this section, fix anything
